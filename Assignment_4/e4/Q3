Since $\{A_1, A_2, A_3\}$ and $\{A_1, A_3, A_4\}$  are keys, 
any subset of attributes of relation R
containing either of the two is going to be a superset.

For the subset that contains $\{A_1, A_2, A_3\}$, we can either select or 
not select the remaining $n-3$ attributes and hence we have $2^{n-3}$ of the 
subsets containing it. Similarily for $\{A_1, A_3, A_4\}$ we have $2^{n-3}$ of
subsets as well. 

The overlap between those supersets are all the sets that contain both 
$A_3$ and $A_4$ the number of such sets is $2^{n-4}$. Then to obtain the 
total number of subsets containing the keys we need to sum up the first two
minus the overlap since it would be double counted. 

Hence we arrive at:

$2^{n-3} + 2^{n-3} - 2^{n-4} = (2+ 2 -1) 2^{n-4} = 3\cdot2^{n-4}$
